# EVE Online PI Templates ![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

This repository contains a collection of templates for Planetary Interaction (PI) in **EVE Online**. These templates are designed to optimize your planet setups and production processes for various resources across different Command Center Upgrades skill levels (CCU).

## Features

- **Preconfigured Templates**: Ready-to-use templates for various planetary resources.
- **Support for Different Command Center Levels (CCU)**: Templates tailored for different CCU skills (CCU IV - CCU V).
- **Resource Optimization**: Templates optimized for maximum efficiency and minimal resource waste.
- **Simple Integration**: Easy to integrate into your EVE Online PI setup.

## What's Included?
- **P0 (RAW) ‚Üí P1 Templates** (Extracting raw resources and refining them into P1 products)
- **P1 ‚Üí P2 Templates** (Further processing P1 products into P2 items)

## Setup

To use these templates in your **EVE Online** Planetary Interaction, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to `/users/<user>/Documents/EVE/PlanetaryInteractionTemplates`
2. Unzip and paste all json files in the folder above.
3. Refresh your templates menu in game.

You can chose specific files from the Miners group. Those are divided on 2 folders. 
- CCU IV for all with skill Command Center Upgrades IV
- CCU V for all with skill Command Center Upgrades V

## üñºÔ∏è Miners Setup & P2 Factory Preview
Here are some example setups to help visualize the planetary layouts:

### **Miners Setup**

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: flex-start;">
    <img src="Templates/images/Miners_setup_preview.png" style="height: auto"; width: auto;">
</div>

*This setup is optimized for maximum extraction efficiency, ensuring a steady flow of raw materials for P1 production.*  

- The **extra Launchpad** (left) is designed for **convenient P1 transfers**, allowing uninterrupted production even when you're not in the same system to pick up resources or transfer them to Orbital Skyhooks.  
- Over time, **resource depletion** will require you to move the extractor head across the planet.  
  - **CCU V templates** allow for this without modifications, as they have spare power.  
  - **CCU IV templates** may require deleting the left Launchpad on some planets to free up power.  
- To keep your facilities running **24/7**, your extractor must produce **1,152,000 P0 (raw materials) per day**.  

### P2 Factory Setup  

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: flex-start;">
    <img src="Templates/images/1_x_P2_Factory_preview.png" style="height: 810px; width: auto;">
    <img src="Templates/images/2_x_P2_Factory_preview.png" style="height: 810px; width: auto;">
</div>

*This is a single **P2 factory** layout. If you have **Command Center Upgrades V (CCU V)**, you can place **two** of these setups on one planet.  
If you have **CCU IV**, you may need to **delete 1 or 2 facilities** from the template to fit within power limits.*  

### **Why this model?**  
- This layout **gives you flexibility**, allowing you to produce **one or multiple P2 products** per planet, depending on your industrial needs.  
- The **central Launchpad** stores **P1 products** and supplies them to the factories to produce **P2 products**.  
- **P2 products** will be stored in the same Launchpad, ensuring **easy access**.  
- **Orbital Skyhooks** can be used to store extra P1 materials and transfer them when production requires it.  
- This setup **maximizes efficiency** while keeping logistics simple.
